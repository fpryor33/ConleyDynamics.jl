    lc, mvfG, mvfC = example_dunce_chaos()

Create a minimal simplicial complex representation
of the Dunce hat, as well as two Forman vector fields.

The function returns the simplicial representation of
the Dunce hat in `lc` over the finite field `GF(2)`.
The Forman vector field `mvfG` is a gradient vector 
field with unique connection matrix. The field `mvfC`
is a modification of this field which merges the critical
cells of dimensions 1 and 2 into a Forman arrow. The
resulting Forman vector field is no longer gradient, 
and in fact exhibits Lorez-like chaos.
