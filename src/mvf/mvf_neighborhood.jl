Determine a multivector neighborhood of a set of cells.

The function returns all multivectors of the multivector field `mvf`
that form a neighborhood of the given cells with a collar width of `n`.
More precisely, for `n = 0` one obtains the multivectors intersecting
the cells in `sources`, while for `n >= 1` the function returns all
multivectors from level `n-1`, together with all multivectors whose
closure intersects the closure of the level `n-1` neighborhood.
Critical cells in this neighborhood will be returned as singletons.
The return type of the multivectors is the same as the type of `mvf`.

Determine a multivector neighborhood of a cell.

The function returns all multivectors of the multivector field `mvf`
that can be reached from the cell `source` in at most `n` steps
forward or backward time. In other words, it computes a neighborhood
of the multivector containing the cell `source` with a thickness
of `n` layers of multivectors. Critical cells in this neighborhood
will be returned as singletons. The return type of the multivectors
is the same as the type of `mvf`.
